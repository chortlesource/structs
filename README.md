# C Structs

## Description

This repo is a collection of basic data structures I have implemented
in C for use within other projects. Each type has a `.h` and `.c` file
and dependencies are listed in the `.h` description.

If you build this project it runs tests against all of the functions I've implemented for each struct. These have been tested against valgrind and currently appear not to leak.
